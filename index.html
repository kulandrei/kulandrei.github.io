              <p class="post-date">Today</p>
              <p>Is my slave worthy of my presence and my conditionate love towards him?</p>
              <p>He's kicking that object every day as if his life depends on it.
                Today I tried it as well while he went to the kitchen to grab some water.
                I almost sent an e-mail to my tomcat friend Nelu.</p>

              <p class="post-date">Today</p>
              <p>Since he adopted this new fitlhy cat, with which I play once in a while, I can't even sleep on him anymore.</p>
              <p>Even so, that does not stop me from meowing next to the kitchen door when he is in the bedroom be it in the evening before sleep or in the morning before mommy wakes up. 
                It must be driving him mad. I wonder for how long he's gonna make it. Just to play it cool, in the morning I bring him my fake mouse and ask him to throw it for me as if I'm a little dog. Confused human, you are merely a petit pawn in my grand plan. Meowhahahahaha!</p>
